     <h1>Machine Learning</h1>

    
<h2>Machine Learning (Under-constructions)</h2>
    <p>So this is a page for us to just start understanding machine-learning.
      They note our status and todos about learning machine learning</p>
    <h2>Learning goals</h2>
    <p>This is a deep topic with many goals. So best to prioritize and order
      the goals</p>
    <h3>Using pre-trained models</h3>
    <p>This is probably the most appropriate and easiest of them all. It treats
      ML like some kind of super smart API. You should probably spend some time
      with ML5 and tensor flow JS for now.&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Algorithms and Machine-Learning actual</h3>
    <p>This is the actual learning for machine learning. This is very deep and
      varied. A whole new subject outside of your scope. I suggest taking the
      long game for this one. and watch Some stuff in the background. Learning
      it one concept at at time.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Sources to learn from:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Coding train sessions (recommended) from algorithms to intelligence</li>
      <li>ML4A: Machine learnings for artist. An alternate curicullum for machine
        learning.&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Topics identified to learn</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>K-Nearest Neighbour</li>
      <li>from scalar, vectors, matrices to tensors</li>
      <li>neural networks</li>
      <li>Convolution neural network</li>
      <li>regression</li>
      <li>feature extraction</li>
    </ul>
