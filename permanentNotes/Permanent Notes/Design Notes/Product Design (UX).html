     <h1>Product Design (UX)</h1>

    
<h2>Previously known as UX</h2>
    <p>The big picture design of softwares. From research and project brief to
      delivery to further iterations. Consists of defining the issue to solve,
      prototyping with &nbsp;wireframes and validating solution with quantitative
      and qualitative analysis.</p>
    <h3><strong>Close relations with UI design</strong></h3>
    <p>see ui design notes here.&nbsp;
      <br>Often grouped in together with UI designers. Cause of the large overlap
      and tools these 2 &nbsp;fields use.&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>The UX baggage.&nbsp;</h3>
    <p>UX has a bad rep of being hocus pocus about their work. Often being frivolous
      and just being up their heads the whole time with their jargon. So best
      to be very objective and analytical with this field. Being data driven
      and backed up by tests. And focusing on solving the problem</p>
    <h2>The Mindset</h2>
    <p>UX came with the image of a bunch of hipsters with post-it notes and hocus
      pocus jargon that wow CEOs but don't actually design. While a lot of great
      things can be found in this field it's also littered with a bunch of useless
      practices. So here is the mindset you should have to avoid it al</p>
    <h5>Being data-driven</h5>
    <p>Use data and research to back-up your claims.&nbsp;</p>
    <h5>User-focused and User respecting</h5>
    <p>Best to be not assume that you are the user. Actually take effort to listen
      to them and define the solutions around their problems and not the company
      goals. &nbsp;</p>
    <h2>The Process</h2>
    <h3>The UX process in brief</h3>
    <p>The process can vary between companies and designers. But they all follow
      the pattern of</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Discovering and Defining the problem</li>
      <li>Designing the Developing the solution</li>
      <li>Empirically Validating the solutions.&nbsp;</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Famous diagrams</h3>

    </p>
    <h3>Problem discovery &nbsp;and definition</h3>
    <p>All about understanding the user's problem. Do your research. honestly
      unless you are in a large company, user interviews and surveys are usually
      enough. Then define the problem and solutions from the user perspective.
      &nbsp;</p>
    <p>Like from “Make Customers checkout items more” to “Create a better shopping
      experience for the user”</p>
    <h3>Designing Solutions&nbsp;</h3>
    <p>Be fast and loose. Prototype with figma. have turnarounds measured in
      1-2 days.
      <br>Also get references from competitors or similar apps.&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Validating the solutions</h3>
    <p>Again just interview should be enough.</p>
