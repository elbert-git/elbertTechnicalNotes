      thoughts and notes to be captured in a single note. that has links and

    <p>Niklas Luhman was the most prolific author to use this. Written a large
      amount of books he credited his productivity to this system.&nbsp;</p>
    <h2><strong>Why people are interested</strong></h2>
    <p>Probably due to the visually beautiful networks created by this system.
      &nbsp;But also when done right. This is an efficient way of note-taking
      and organizing thought.&nbsp;</p>
    <h2><strong>Luhman's workflow</strong></h2>
    <p><u>Literature notes</u>
      <br>As you consume content. You create notes that you want to remember. Putting
      it into your own words.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><u>References</u>
      <br>Create a note for important sources that can be linked to. This note should
      just be brief glimpse into the source.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><u>Fleeting notes</u>
      <br>This is like his inbox. His bin of random ideas. In this system he can
      link the cards he needs</p>
    <p><u>Permanent notes</u>
      <br>This is like his technical notes. Solidifying a structure seen in the
      inbox, literature and fleeting notes</p>
    <p><span class="text-big"><strong>In essence</strong></span>

    <h2><strong>How I want to use it</strong></h2>
    <p><u>What do I want to get from it?</u>
      <br>I think I just want a better note editor which is this trilium program.
      But I hope this improves our note-taking abiility. &nbsp;</p>
    <p><u>The workflow I would use</u>
      <br>I would disregard the fleeting notes. I have my own system for it.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><u>Some tips to bound this to useful tool and not a useless time-sink</u>
      <br>Use it as your new technical notes first. Then let the benefits come Organically</p>
