     <h1>VFX Graph</h1>

    
<h2>VFX Graph</h2>
    <p>It's essentially a UI to do gpu particles</p>
    <h2>Creating a graph</h2>
    <p>Just right click into a folder &gt; Create &gt; Visual Effects &gt; Visual
      Effect Graph. You can edit the vfx graph here. Then you can literally drag
      it into the viewport to spawn an instance</p>
    <h2>How the graph works</h2>
    <figure class="image image-style-align-center image_resized" style="width:59.19%;">
      <img src="VFX%20Graph/SystemVisual.png" alt="The vertical workflow contains Systems, which then contain Contexts, which then contain Blocks. Together, they determine when something happens during the “lifecycle” of the visual effect.">
    </figure>
    <p>The system works from top to bottom. like in the image. Just add blocks
      to different sections to handle how it applies</p>
    <h3>Example from brackeys</h3>

    <p>Excellent tut on the workflow. Showing how to create trails and secondary
      particle systems from the main one.&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Creating Parameters</h2>
    <p>Somewhere in the stack you will see parameters with a circle to the left.
      You can drag them out to create external parameters to control in the inspector.
      You can change details like texture input, vectors and floats yadda yadda</p>
    <h2>Mixing with shaders</h2>
