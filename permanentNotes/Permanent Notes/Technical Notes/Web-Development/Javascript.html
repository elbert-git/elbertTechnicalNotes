     <h1>Javascript</h1>

    
<h2>Javascript</h2>
    <p>The lingua-franca of full-stack web development. Run on the browsers and
      web-servers.&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Where does it runs</h3>
    <p>Javascript runs on browsers via the script that and on servers via environments
      like node. And because of that the language slightly behaves differently
      depending on where you run it.&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Miscellaneous notes</h3>
    <p>Javascript has many quirks due it's quick creation and long history.</p>
    <h6>ES6&nbsp;</h6>
    <p>The modern way of writing javascript that has been adopted widely since
      2016 (see below for more details)</p>
    <h5>Typescript&nbsp;</h5>
    <p>A new language that can be easily transpiled for a better developer experience.
      Removes a good number of weird bugs javascript would have. (at the cost
      of some boiler plate)</p>
