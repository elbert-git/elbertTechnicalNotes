    <h2>HTTP is open by default</h2>
    <p>HTTP is a public communication tool first. Mean you can snoop into other's
      requests since it's a public ping. To get around this, people encrypt their
      messages before sending it</p>
    <h2>TLS</h2>
    <p>is the common standard agreement of how creating secure encrypted channels
      between server and client</p>
    <h2>HTTPs</h2>
    <p>is just a certificate signed by a security agency to verify yes TLS is
      working</p>
