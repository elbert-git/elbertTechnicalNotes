<h2>Debugging shaders</h2>
    <p>Yeah you can't console.log anything. threejs does have a good error finder
      when you run it. and can give you a hint on where the issue is. but it's
      still tricky.</p>
    <p>The only way is to use test values. like using colour to show what you
      need to show. that's all lol</p>
