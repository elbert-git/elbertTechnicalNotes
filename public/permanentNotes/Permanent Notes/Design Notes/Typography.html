<h2>Typography</h2>
    <p>The study of using typefaces and layouts to better communicate.</p>
    <h3>Font vs typefaces</h3>
    <p>Typefaces are the family of fonts, like helvetica and futura. Fonts are
      the specific variation of typefaces, like 10 point bold helvetica.</p>
    <h2>Parts of a font</h2>

    </figure>
    <h2>Choosing typefaces</h2>
    <h3>Serif and Sans-serif</h3>
    <p>The first question to ask is do you want a classical look or contemporary.
      If classical pick serif-ed fonts. And vice versa
      <br>serif = old and classic
      <br>sans-serif = contemporary or new</p>
    <h3>Common types and new common types</h3>
    <p>There are some types that are so prevalent that you can't go wrong with
      choosing them most of the time.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Garamond</strong>: for the intellectual</li>
      <li><strong>Bodoni</strong>: For Elegant and fancy stuff</li>
      <li><strong>Century </strong>Expanded: for best legibility</li>
      <li><strong>Futura</strong>: for the modern minimalist</li>
      <li><strong>Times </strong>Roman: for the default</li>
      <li><strong>Helvetica</strong>: the most versatile font</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Layout and hierarchy</h2>
    <p>There are many things to keep in mind with laying out typefaces</p>
    <h3>Sizes</h3>
    <p>Pick a base size first. usually 16px in your case. And all your other
      sizes should be based on that. &nbsp;lIke 2x or 4x of that.</p>
    <p>Use <a href="https://type-scale.com/">type-scale.com&nbsp;</a> to see other
      scales systems of type.&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Line weight</h3>
    <p>Best to skip a weight for contrast and hierachy</p>
    <h3>Avoid the corners</h3>
    <p>Types need negative space. Break this rule when you understand why &nbsp;you
      need to break it</p>
    <h3>Align to lines.&nbsp;</h3>
    <p>Align to common baselines and column lines. Order makes things look tidy
      and in harmony</p>
