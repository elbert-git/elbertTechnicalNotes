# Polymorphism and inheritance
*   using parent or child version of variables and fucntiosn

> Unity polymorphism/inheritance
> ------------------------------

what?
-----

Basically you can create classes that derives functions and behaviours from the parent.

like creating a base interactable class then, creating puzzle interactable class, pickup interactble class.

or creating an animal class then creating dog, cat, ant class.

How?
----

```
public class ClassName : ParentClassName
{
    public Start()
    {
        // code
    }
}
```

that's it. just mark the parent class after the declaring the class.

Accessing parent/child version of data or functions
---------------------------------------------------

usually only the child class is accessed by default when you refer to the class instance.

but sometimes you cant to access the parent's instead;

to access the parent's version. just use base

```
base.FunctionName();
base.variableName();
```

Inheriting MonoBehaviour
------------------------

most of the time in unity projects you just want to inherit monobehaviors

including the parent's start and update functions.

you can do that by

```
public class ClassName : ParentClassName
{
    public Start()
    {
        base.Start(); //this executes parent's start func
    }

    public Update()
    {
        base.Update(); //this executes parent's Update func
    }
}
```

Overriding functions
--------------------

maybe you want a function derived in the parent class. to be called different in all the children.

first you need to make the parent function overridable

```
public virtual void FunctionName(){
  // code here
}
```

just make it public and virtual in the function declaration.

in the child class, to override do this

```
public override void FunctionName(){
  // code here this overrides the parent's function.
}
```
